            <p>
                Known for his love of video games, Deadmau5 boss was playing the online shooter PlayerUnknown’s
                Battlegrounds apparently called his opponent a “f*cking c*ck-sucking stream sniper f*g,” when he was
                defeated, according to Queerty. The outburst was labeled by Twitch as "hate-speech" and Zimmerman
                received a ban from the platform shortly after...

            <h2>Deadmau5 Premieres New Song ‘Coasted’</h2>
            <p>
                Deadmau5, aka Joel Zimmerman, has been touring with a new live show, Cube V3, this past year. On
                Thursday, the electronic dance producer shared one of his new songs from the show, “Coasted,” following
                the released of “Satrn” earlier this month.

                Cube V3 is a continuation of Deadmau5’s Cube live series, which debuted at Coachella in April 2010 and
                helped launch the producer into fame. This iteration of the show — which debuted this past March and
                features a central cube that can rotate 360 degrees — will continue touring North America into 2020,
                with a final set of shows at Brooklyn’s Great Hall at Avant Gardner, ending February 6th. Zimmerman met
                up with YouTuber Sam Sheffer for a behind-the-scenes tour of the new Cube show and design in August.

            <h2>Hotly anticipated deadmau5 ID is coming soon</h2>
            <p>
                Playing the waiting game for an ID can be extremely painful and long at times, especially when that ID
                is probably one of the best things you’ve heard in a long time. All edm fans know this feeling, but the
                wait is awarded when the track you have come to know and love through show recordings or low quality
                rips finally is unleashed to official streaming platforms. deadmau5 fans have been waiting in particular
                for these two IDs that he’s been playing out since as early as 2018. ‘Coasted‘ and ‘Saturn’ have become
                staples in the helmet-wearing producer’s sets as of late, and now one of them is finally being released
                very soon.
